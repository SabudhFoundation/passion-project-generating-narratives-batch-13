"Trump said, I think we have the worst inflation weve had in 100 years. They say its 48 years, I dont believe it.","Trump framed this as an opinion, but its baseless nonetheless  wrong in two different ways. First, even when the inflation rate hit its Biden-era peak of 9.1% in June 2022, that 9.1% rate was the highest since 1981  between 40 and 41 years prior, certainly not 100 years and not even 48 years. Second, inflation has declined sharply since the June 2022 peak, and the most recent available rate at the time he spoke, for July 2024, was 3.2%  a rate that, the Biden presidency aside, was exceeded as recently as 2011.",,"The claim that former President Donald Trump asserted, ""I think we have the worst inflation we've had in 100 years,"" is a statement that requires a closer examination of historical inflation rates to ascertain its accuracy. Although Trump framed this statement as an opinion, the factual context reveals that the claim is, in fact, misleading and incorrect in two distinct ways.

Firstly, it is essential to consider the historical context of inflation rates. The inflation rate peaked during the Biden administration in June 2022, reaching 9.1%. While this was indeed a high inflation rate, it is not accurate to claim that it represents the worst inflation in 100 years. In reality, the highest inflation rate since 1981 occurred in 1981, which was between 40 and 41 years prior. This means that Trump's claim exaggerates the duration of the highest inflation rates by a significant margin.

Secondly, it is crucial to acknowledge that the inflation rate has shown a notable decline since its peak in June 2022. The most recent available data from July 2024 indicates an inflation rate of 3.2%. This rate, while higher than the rate experienced during the Biden presidency, was not unprecedented. The inflation rate of 3.2% was exceeded as recently as 2011, demonstrating that the inflationary trend has not been unique to the Biden administration or the current economic climate.

In conclusion, while Trump's statement may have been framed as an opinion, it is crucial to evaluate it against historical inflation data. The claim that the inflation rate during the Biden presidency represents the worst inflation in 100 years is both exaggerated and inaccurate. The highest inflation rate since 1981 occurred over 40 years ago, and the current inflation rate, while higher than that experienced during the Biden presidency, is not unprecedented. Therefore, it is essential to base economic analyses on factual data and avoid unsupported assumptions."
"Trump claimed, Our crime rates going through the roof.","Trumps claim is false. Both violent crime and property crime dropped significantly in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024. 

data sources make it clear crime has indeed declined to some extent.

The preliminary FBI data for 2023 showed a roughly 13% decline in murder and a roughly 6% decline in overall violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in Trumps last calendar year in office in 2020. The preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023  a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall violent crime.

Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said earlier this year that if the final 2023 figures show a decline in murder of at least 10% from 2022, this would be the fastest US decline ever recorded. And he noted that both the preliminary FBI-published data from the first quarter of 2024 and also crime data collected from several independent sources point to an even larger decline in property and violent crime, including a substantially larger drop in murder, so far this year compared to 2023, though there is still time left in the year for those trends to change.

After Trump claimed in June that crime is so much up, Anna Harvey, a political science professor and director of the Public Safety Lab at New York University, noted to CNN that the claim is contradicted both by the data from the FBI and from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which represents 70 large US police forces. She said: It would be more accurate to say that crime is so much down.",,"In June, President Donald Trump made a sweeping statement about the rise in crime, claiming, ""Our crime rate's going through the roof."" However, this assertion stands in stark contrast to the factual data presented by authoritative sources such as the FBI and crime data experts. The claim made by President Trump does not hold up when examined against the concrete evidence of crime trends in the United States.

According to the FBI's preliminary data for 2023, the nation witnessed a significant decline in both violent and property crimes. Murder rates decreased by approximately 13%, while overall violent crime fell by roughly 6% compared to the previous year. This data shows that crime levels in 2023 were lower than they were during President Trump's last year in office, 2020. Furthermore, the first quarter of 2024 revealed an even more substantial drop in crime rates, with a 26% decline in murder and a 15% decline in overall violent crime compared to the same period in 2023.

Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of AH Datalytics, further supports this downward trend, stating that if the final 2023 figures show a decline in murder of at least 10% from 2022, it would be the fastest decline ever recorded in the United States. Asher also emphasized that the preliminary FBI-published data from the first quarter of 2024 and crime data collected from independent sources indicate an even larger decline in property and violent crime, including a substantial drop in murder, compared to the previous year.

In light of these facts, it would be more accurate to say that crime is so much down in the United States, rather than claiming it is soaring as President Trump suggested. As Anna Harvey, a political science professor and director of the Public Safety Lab at New York University, noted, the data from the FBI and the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which represents 70 large US police forces, directly contradicts the President's claim.

In conclusion, President Trump's statement that crime rates are on the rise is not supported by the available data. Instead, the facts show a clear and significant decrease in crime levels in the United States. It is crucial to base our understanding of crime trends on accurate and reliable information rather than relying on misleading claims."
"Trump argued that the threat of the nuclear war is far more important than the threat posed by climate change. And he said: The biggest threat? Its not global warming, where the oceans gonna rise one eighth of an inch over the next 400 years  and youll have more oceanfront property, right?","Trumps claim about the pace of sea-level rise is wildly inaccurate. The global average sea level is currently rising more per year than Trump claimed that it will rise in 400 years. 

NASA reported in March that the current global average sea-level rise in 2023 was 0.17 inches per year, more than double the rate in 1993. And a World Meteorological Organization report this year said the rate of sea level rise between 2014 and 2023 was about 0.19 inches per year.

In other words, sea level rise is already more than an eighth of an inch annually  and it is accelerating. NASA found a jump of 0.3 inches between 2022 and 2023.

Gary Griggs, a University of California, Santa Cruz professor of earth and planetary sciences who studies sea-level rise, said last year that Trumps similar claims can only be described as totally out of touch with reality and that Trump has no idea what he is talking about.

Sea levels rise by different amounts in different locations. For the US, sea levels are expected to rise particularly fast for the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast  and Trumps state of Florida, which is bordered by both of those coasts, is expected to be affected more severely than many other coastal states.

In fact, Trumps claims about sea levels are highly inaccurate for the area near Mar-a-Lago, which is on the Atlantic. Griggs noted in a June email that data from the closest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge to Mar-a-Lago shows an increase of an eighth of an inch roughly every nine months.

Trump has also previously made the joke about rising seas creating more oceanfront property. In reality, rising sea levels are expected to have devastating consequences not only for many seafront properties but for areas further inland  rendering some communities uninhabitable and others more dangerous, increasing the frequency and reach of flooding, making hurricanes more destructive and damaging infrastructure and ecosystems.",,"The assertion that President Trump prioritized the threat of nuclear war over climate change, while misleading, does not negate the severity of the latter. It is crucial to address the specific claim that Trump suggested the sea-level rise over the next 400 years would be minimal, potentially leading to more oceanfront property. However, this claim is not only inaccurate but also misleading in the context of the current rate of sea-level rise.

Recent data from NASA and the World Meteorological Organization indicate that the global average sea-level rise in 2023 was 0.17 inches per year, more than double the rate in 1993. Furthermore, the rate of sea level rise between 2014 and 2023 was approximately 0.19 inches per year. This means that the sea level is already rising at a rate of more than an eighth of an inch annually, and this rate is accelerating.

Gary Griggs, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, stated that Trump's claims about sea levels are ""totally out of touch with reality"" and that he ""has no idea what he is talking about."" Sea levels rise by different amounts in different locations, with the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast, including Trump's home state of Florida, expected to be affected more severely.

In the area near Mar-a-Lago, the closest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge shows an increase of an eighth of an inch roughly every nine months. This rapid rate of sea-level rise will have devastating consequences for many seafront properties and areas further inland. Rising sea levels are expected to increase the frequency and reach of flooding, make hurricanes more destructive, and damage infrastructure and ecosystems.

In conclusion, while it is essential to address the threats posed by nuclear war, it is equally crucial to acknowledge and address the severity of the threat posed by climate change, particularly the accelerating rate of sea-level rise. Ignoring or minimizing this issue is not only inaccurate but also dangerous for the future of our planet and its inhabitants."
"Trump told Musk that you got a lot of people listening to the conversation  like 60 million or something. He then asked somebody what the number was, but he never corrected his initial estimate.","Trump did express uncertainty about the number, but his like 60 million or something claim is false. At the time he made this remark, public data on X showed that there were 1.1 million accounts listening to the conversation. 

Trump appeared to be referring to something different: the number of views on his own X post sharing the space where the conversation was played. But the vast majority of the accounts that viewed the post did not actually listen to the conversation.",,"The claim that President Donald Trump told Elon Musk that ""you got a lot of people listening"" to a conversation, with an estimate of around 60 million, has been widely circulated. However, this assertion is not supported by factual evidence. In reality, at the time of the conversation, public data indicated that only 1.1 million accounts were actively listening to the discussion.

The claim seems to stem from Trump's vague and uncertain statement, where he used phrases such as ""like 60 million or something."" This statement does not provide a concrete figure, and it's crucial to distinguish between speculation and factual information. Trump's statement, as it stands, does not hold up to scrutiny and should not be taken as a reliable source of information.

Additionally, it's essential to understand the context of Trump's remarks. It appears that he was referring to the number of views on his X post, which shared the space where the conversation took place. However, this number is misleading, as the majority of the accounts that viewed the post did not actually listen to the conversation.

In conclusion, the claim that Trump stated ""you got a lot of people listening"" to a conversation, with an estimate of around 60 million, is not supported by factual evidence. Trump's statement was vague and uncertain, and it seems that he was referring to the number of views on his X post, not the number of accounts actively listening to the conversation. It's crucial to rely on factual information and avoid spreading unsupported claims, especially during such a significant event as an election."
"Trump claimed of Harris: She wants to release all the prisoners that are in detention, and some of these guys are really bad. That just came out today.","This is false. There is no basis for the claim that Harris wants to release all the prisoners that are in detention. Trump appeared to be referring to news stories in conservative media that reported that Harris had said in 2019, while unsuccessfully running in the Democratic presidential primary, that she wanted to close privately-run immigration detention centers. 

Even if Harris continues to hold this position today  she has not addressed the subject since she began her presidential campaign in July  closing privately-run immigration detention centers would not result in the release of all prisoners in immigration detention, let alone all prisoners in regular US jails and prisons; Trump did not specify that he was talking about Harris past stance on certain immigration detention facilities rather than all prisons.

Its possible Trump had been misled himself; a short clip shared by some Republicans on social media this week did not include the part of Harris 2019 remarks where she specified that she was referring to privately run immigration detention facilities in particular.
But articles by Fox News and The New York Post correctly noted that this was what she said.",,"The claim that Kamala Harris wants to release all prisoners in detention, including those in regular US jails and prisons, is not accurate. This assertion appears to be based on a misinterpretation of Harris' 2019 comments during her unsuccessful run for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Harris' stance was specifically focused on privately-run immigration detention centers. She argued that these facilities should be closed due to their lack of transparency, accountability, and potential for abuse. Harris did not advocate for the release of all prisoners, but rather called for a shift in the way immigration detention is managed.

It is important to note that Harris has not addressed this issue since she began her presidential campaign in July 2019. Her position on immigration detention remains consistent with her earlier remarks, which were widely reported by reputable news outlets such as Fox News and The New York Post.

The claim that Harris wants to release all prisoners in detention is an overgeneralization that fails to consider the nuances of her position. Furthermore, it is essential to distinguish between immigration detention and the criminal justice system in the United States. The two systems operate independently, with different objectives and guidelines for detention.

Closing privately-run immigration detention centers would not result in the release of all prisoners in the United States. Instead, it would help address the concerns regarding the treatment of immigrants and the accountability of private companies involved in immigration detention.

While it is possible that Trump may have been misled by incomplete or misleading information, it is crucial to rely on factual evidence when discussing political candidates' positions. In this case, the claim that Harris wants to release all prisoners in detention is not supported by the available evidence. Instead, it is essential to examine the candidate's actual stance and policy proposals to form a well-informed opinion."
"Trump claimed of Harris: She was the border czar, and people cant allow them to get away with their disinformation campaign. Now, shes saying she wasnt really involved  she was totally in charge.","This is false. Harris was never made Bidens border czar, a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate, and was never totally in charge of the border; Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is the official in charge of border security. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States.

Some Republicans have scoffed at assertions that Harris was never the border czar, noting on social media that news articles sometimes described Harris as such. But those articles were wrong. Various news outlets, including CNN, reported as early as the first half of 2021 that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole, as border czar strongly suggests, and had instead been handed a diplomatic task related to Central American countries.

A White House fact sheet in July 2021 said: On February 2, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that called for the development of a Root Causes Strategy.
Since March, Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading the Administrations diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.

Bidens own comments at a March 2021 event announcing the assignment were slightly more muddled, but he said he had asked Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to address factors causing migration in the three Northern Triangle countries (he also mentioned Mexico that day). Biden listed factors in these countries he thought had led to migration and said that if you deal with the problems in-country, it benefits everyone. And Harris comments that day were focused squarely on root causes.

Republicans can fairly say that even root causes work is a border-related task. But calling her border czar goes too far.
",,"The claim that Kamala Harris was referred to as the ""border czar"" and was ""totally in charge"" of the U.S. border is inaccurate and misleading. This narrative is based on a misunderstanding of her actual role during President Joe Biden's administration.

Harris was never officially appointed as the ""border czar."" Instead, she was given a diplomatic task related to Central American countries. In February 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that called for the development of a Root Causes Strategy to address migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. In response, Vice President Kamala Harris was tasked with leading the Administration's diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration in these countries.

Various news outlets, including CNN, reported that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole. Instead, she was focused on diplomatic efforts to address the factors causing migration in the three Northern Triangle countries. The White House's July 2021 fact sheet further confirmed this, stating that Harris was leading the diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.

President Biden's comments at a March 2021 event also indicated that Harris' role was focused on addressing the root causes of migration. He said he had asked Harris to lead their diplomatic effort to address the problems in-country, which he believed would benefit everyone. Harris' comments that day were also focused squarely on root causes.

Republicans can fairly say that addressing the root causes of migration is a border-related task. However, calling Harris the ""border czar"" and claiming she was ""totally in charge"" of the border goes too far. In reality, Harris' role was focused on diplomacy and addressing the underlying causes of migration, rather than being the sole leader of border security."
"While talking about illegal immigration, Trump claimed that, under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, you have millions of people coming in a month.","This is false. There has not been any month under the Biden-Harris administration where even close to millions of people entered the country illegally. In the peak month during this administration for what the government calls border encounters, December 2023, there were 370,890 encounters nationwide. Even if you factor in so-called gotaways, people who evaded the Border Patrol to sneak into the country, there is no basis for the claim that millions of people are entering in a single month.

The number of nationwide encounters was 205,019 in June, the last month for which data is currently available to the public.",,"The claim that millions of people are entering the United States illegally each month under the Biden-Harris administration is not supported by available data. This assertion appears to be a significant overstatement, as the number of nationwide encounters, as reported by the government, does not reach the scale of millions even in the peak month of December 2023.

In December 2023, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recorded 370,890 border encounters nationwide. This number is substantial, but it is nowhere near the figure of millions of people entering the country illegally in a single month. It is essential to consider that not all border encounters result in apprehensions, and many encounters may involve individuals who are not entering illegally but are simply passing through the border or seeking assistance.

To provide context, in June 2023, the last month for which data is currently available to the public, there were 205,019 nationwide encounters. While this number is higher than the peak month of December, it still falls short of the claim that millions of people are entering the country illegally each month.

Furthermore, the claim that millions of people are entering the country illegally in a single month disregards the efforts made by the Biden-Harris administration to address border security and manage migration flows. The administration has implemented measures to improve processing times, enhance infrastructure, and increase the number of border patrol agents. These efforts have resulted in a more efficient and humane approach to border management, ensuring that individuals seeking asylum or other forms of legal entry are treated with dignity and respect.

In conclusion, the claim that millions of people are entering the United States illegally each month under the Biden-Harris administration is not supported by available data. The number of nationwide encounters remains well below the figure of millions, even in the peak month of December 2023. Additionally, the administration's efforts to improve border security and manage migration flows demonstrate a commitment to addressing this issue responsibly and humanely."
"Trump repeated a claim he has made on numerous occasions during his campaign  that the Biden administration orchestrated a criminal election subversion case that was brought against him by a local district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, a criminal fraud case that was brought against him by a local district attorney in Manhattan, and a civil fraud case that was brought against him by the attorney general of New York state.","This is false. There is no evidence that Biden or his administration were behind any of these cases. None of these officials reports to the president or even to the federal government.

Attorney General Merrick Garland testified to Congress in early June about the Manhattan case in which Trump was found guilty: The Manhattan district attorney has jurisdiction over cases involving New York state law, completely independent of the Justice Department, which has jurisdiction over cases involving federal law. We do not control the Manhattan district attorney. The Manhattan district attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes its own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.

As he did in his conversation with Musk, Trump has repeatedly invoked a lawyer on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Braggs team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022 to join the district attorneys office as senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelos employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg were colleagues in the New York attorney generals office before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021
",,"The claim that the Biden administration orchestrated a series of criminal and civil fraud cases against former President Donald Trump is unfounded and inaccurate. The basis of this claim lies in the misinterpretation of the roles and jurisdictions of various legal authorities, as well as the employment decisions of certain legal professionals.

Firstly, it's important to clarify the jurisdiction of the Manhattan district attorney (DA). As Attorney General Merrick Garland testified to Congress in June, the DA operates independently of the federal government, specifically the Justice Department. The DA's office has jurisdiction over cases involving New York state law, and they make their own decisions about which cases to pursue under this state law. Therefore, any cases brought by the DA against Trump were solely within their purview and not influenced by the Biden administration or federal authorities.

Moreover, the involvement of Matthew Colangelo, a lawyer on DA Alvin Bragg's team, in these cases does not imply any connection to the Biden administration. Colangelo joined the DA's office as senior counsel to Bragg in 2022, after leaving the Justice Department in 2021. There is no evidence to suggest that Biden had any hand in Colangelo's employment decision, nor that he had any influence over the DA's decision to pursue cases against Trump. Colangelo and Bragg were colleagues in the New York attorney general's office before Bragg's election as DA in 2021.

In conclusion, the claim that the Biden administration orchestrated criminal and civil fraud cases against Trump is unfounded. The cases in question were pursued independently by the Manhattan DA, based on New York state law, and the employment of Matthew Colangelo in the DA's office was a result of his own professional decisions. The counter-narrative presented here is grounded in facts and avoids any unsupported assumptions."
"Trump claimed that before he signed a Right to Try law in 2018 to give terminally ill patients easier access to experimental medications that havent yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, such patients would have no recourse if they did not have the money to travel abroad.
He said: You know, people  if they had money, theyd go to Asia, theyd go to Europe. If they dont have money, theyd go home and die. Thats what happened, theyd go home and die.","It is not true that terminally ill patients would simply have to go home and die without any access to experimental medications or would have to go to foreign countries seeking such treatments until Trump signed the Right to Try law. Prior to the law, patients had to ask the federal government for permission to access experimental medications  but the government almost always said yes.

Scott Gottlieb, who served as Trumps FDA commissioner, told Congress in 2017 that the FDA had approved 99% of patient requests under its own expanded access program.

Emergency requests for individual patients are usually granted immediately over the phone and non-emergency requests are generally processed within a few days, Gottlieb testified.
",,"The claim that terminally ill patients would have no recourse but to either succumb to their illnesses or travel abroad for experimental treatments prior to the enactment of the ""Right to Try"" law in 2018 presents a misleading picture of the options available to these patients. In reality, the narrative of desperation and limited choices was not entirely accurate, as there were existing avenues for patients to gain access to experimental medications.

The FDA's ""expanded access"" program, known as compassionate use, was a vital resource for patients seeking access to investigational drugs. This program allowed patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions to access investigational medications outside of clinical trials when no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy options were available. Under this program, patients could request access to experimental drugs, and the FDA would evaluate the request on a case-by-case basis.

In 2017, Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner at the time, testified before Congress that the FDA had approved 99% of patient requests under the ""expanded access"" program. This statistic indicates that the majority of patients who sought access to experimental treatments were able to receive it through this program. Emergency requests for individual patients were usually granted immediately over the phone, and non-emergency requests were generally processed within a few days.

The ""Right to Try"" law, signed by President Trump in 2018, aimed to further facilitate access to experimental medications for terminally ill patients by allowing them to try investigational drugs without enrolling in clinical trials. However, the law did not render the existing ""expanded access"" program obsolete. Instead, it served as an additional avenue for patients to access experimental treatments, particularly for those who were not eligible for the ""Right to Try"" law.

In conclusion, the claim that terminally ill patients had no recourse but to either succumb to their illnesses or travel abroad for experimental treatments prior to the ""Right to Try"" law is not entirely accurate. The FDA's ""expanded access"" program provided a significant pathway for patients to access investigational drugs, and the ""Right to Try"" law further expanded these options. It is essential to recognize the existing resources available to terminally ill patients and the efforts made to improve their access to experimental medications."
"After talking about the state of US military equipment, Trump said, We gave $85 billion of it back to Afghanistan, if you can believe it. We gave them $85 billion.","Trumps $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion  a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.

As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the $85 billion is a rounded-up figure (its closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A minority of this funding was for equipment.",,"The claim that former President Donald Trump stated the US had given $85 billion worth of military equipment back to Afghanistan is factually incorrect. The assertion is misleading and misrepresents the reality of US military support to Afghan forces during and after the war.

Firstly, it is essential to understand that the $85 billion figure does not refer to the value of military equipment but rather the total amount of money Congress appropriated to a fund supporting Afghan security forces from 2005 to 2021. The fund, known as the Security Forces Fund, was part of the larger War in Afghanistan Costs report. Of the approximately $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces, only about $7.1 billion was valued, according to the Defense Department. Therefore, the $85 billion figure is an overestimation.

Moreover, it is crucial to consider that some of the equipment left behind by the US was inoperable before US forces withdrew. This means that the actual value of military equipment abandoned to the Taliban was significantly lower than the claim suggests.

In conclusion, the claim that the US gave $85 billion worth of military equipment back to Afghanistan is false. The misleading figure is a rounded-up estimate of the total amount of money Congress appropriated for the Afghan security forces fund. The actual value of military equipment abandoned to the Taliban is closer to $7.1 billion, which is a small fraction of the total funding provided during the war."

While it is true that patients faced challenges in accessing experimental drugs prior to the law's enactment, they still had options within the United States, contrary to the assertion that they had no choice but to travel abroad.

The Right to Try law was introduced to provide terminally ill patients with easier access to experimental medications that have not yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, before this law was enacted, patients could still seek access to experimental drugs through the FDA's expanded access program. This program allowed patients to ask the federal government for permission to use unapproved drugs outside of clinical trials.

According to Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA commissioner under President Trump, the FDA had approved 99% of patient requests under the expanded access program. Emergency requests for individual patients were usually granted immediately over the phone, while non-emergency requests were generally processed within a few days. This means that terminally ill patients had a chance to receive potentially life-saving treatments without having to travel abroad or wait for a lengthy approval process.

Furthermore, the claim that patients would simply go home and die without any access to experimental medications overlooks the fact that the expanded access program provided a viable alternative for patients seeking access to experimental drugs. In reality, terminally ill patients had a range of options available to them, including the expanded access program, before the Right to Try law was signed.

In conclusion, the claim that terminally ill patients had no recourse and would simply have to go home and die without access to experimental medications before the Right to Try law was signed in 2018 is false. Patients had options within the United States, and the expanded access program provided a pathway for them to access experimental drugs.

We do not control the Manhattan district attorney. The Manhattan district attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes its own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.

As he did in his conversation with Musk, Trump has repeatedly invoked a lawyer on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Braggs team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022 to join the district attorneys office as senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelos employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg were colleagues in the New York attorney generals office before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021",,"The claim that President Trump has asserted, suggesting that the Biden administration orchestrated criminal election subversion, fraud, and civil fraud cases against him, is unfounded and lacks credible evidence. This assertion overlooks the jurisdictional and operational independence of the various law enforcement and judicial entities involved in these cases.

The Manhattan District Attorney's office, which prosecuted the election subversion case in which Trump was found guilty, operates under state law and is independent of the federal Justice Department. As stated by Attorney General Merrick Garland, the district attorney makes decisions autonomously, without any control or reporting obligations to the Justice Department or the federal government. This independence ensures that the Manhattan district attorney's actions are not influenced by the Biden administration.

Furthermore, the claim that the Biden administration orchestrated a civil fraud case against Trump, brought by the New York attorney general's office, also falls apart under scrutiny. The New York attorney general's office operates under state law and is separate from the federal government, with no direct influence or control from the Biden administration.

Additionally, the claim that Matthew Colangelo, a lawyer on the Manhattan District Attorney's team, was hired by the Biden administration is baseless. Colangelo's decision to join the district attorney's office as senior counsel to Alvin Bragg was a personal choice made after his departure from the Justice Department in 2022. There is no evidence to suggest that Biden had any involvement in this employment decision.

In conclusion, the claim that the Biden administration orchestrated these cases against Trump is unfounded. The law enforcement and judicial entities involved in these cases operate independently, with no influence or control from the Biden administration. As such, the claim lacks credibility and should be dismissed as baseless."
"Touting his record in dealing with Iran, Trump claimed, They had no money for Hamas, they had no money for Hezbollah, they had no money for any of these instruments of terror.","Trumps claim that Iran had no money for terror groups during his presidency is false. Irans funding for these groups did decline in the second half of his administration, in large part because his sanctions on Iran had a major negative impact on the Iranian economy, but the funding never stopped entirely, as four experts told CNN in June. Trumps own administration said in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups including Hezbollah. 



The Trump administration began imposing sanctions on Iran in late 2018, pursuing a campaign known as maximum pressure. But Trump-appointed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said himself in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups.



So you continue to have, in spite of the Iranian leadership demanding that more money be given to them, they are using the resources that they have to continue funding Hezbollah in Lebanon and threatening the state of Israel, funding Iraqi terrorist Shia groups, all the things that they have done historically  continuing to build out their capabilities even while the people inside of their own country are suffering, Pompeo said in a May 2020 interview, according to a transcript posted on the State Departments website.



Trump could have fairly said that his sanctions on Iran had made life more difficult for terror groups (though its unclear how much their operations were affected). Instead, he continued his years-old practice of exaggerating even legitimate achievements.",,"The claim made by former President Trump that Iran had ""no money"" for terror groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and Shia militias in Iraq during his presidency is not only misleading but also contradicted by credible sources and reports. Trump's administration indeed initiated a campaign of ""maximum pressure"" on Iran in late 2018, imposing stringent sanctions that severely impacted the Iranian economy. These measures were part of a broader strategy to curb Iran's regional influence and its alleged support for terrorist organizations.

However, the assertion that Iran completely stopped funding these groups is inaccurate. Four experts interviewed by CNN in June 2019 provided evidence to the contrary, stating that while the funding for these groups had significantly declined, it never ceased entirely. This decline can be attributed to the crippling effect of the sanctions on Iran's economy, which limited the financial resources available to support such groups.

Moreover, the Trump administration's own statements in 2020 further debunk the claim that Iran had stopped funding terror groups. Mike Pompeo, the former Secretary of State, acknowledged in a May 2020 interview that Iran continued to allocate resources to fund Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iraqi Shia militias, and other entities that posed threats to the state of Israel. Pompeo noted that despite the Iranian leadership's demands for more funds, the country continued to use its limited resources to sustain these organizations, even as its own citizens suffered from the economic consequences of the sanctions.

In conclusion, the claim that Trump's sanctions on Iran led to a complete cessation of funding for terror groups is false. While the sanctions did have a significant impact on Iran's ability to support these organizations, the funding never stopped entirely. The reality is that the Trump administration's strategy of ""maximum pressure"" did lead to a decline in Iran's financial support for these groups, but it was not as drastic as Trump's claim suggests."
"Trump repeated his familiar claim that he successfully pressured China into no longer buying oil from Iran.
Iran was broke because I told China, If you buy from Iran Oil, its all about the oil, thats where the money is. If you buy oil from Iran, youre not going to do any business with the United States. And I meant it, and they said, Well pass, and they didnt buy oil.","Trumps claim is false. Chinas oil imports from Iran did briefly plummet under Trump in 2019, the year the Trump administration made a concerted effort to deter such purchases, but they never stopped  and then they rose sharply again while Trump was still president. The claim is untrue because Chinese crude imports from Iran havent stopped at all, Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the Americas at Kpler, a market intelligence firm, said in November, when Trump made a similar claim.



Chinas official statistics recorded no purchases of Iranian crude in Trumps last partial month in office, January 2021, and also none in most of Bidens first year in office. But that doesnt mean Chinas imports actually ceased; industry experts say it is widely known that China has used a variety of tactics to mask its continued imports from Iran.

Smith said Iranian crude is often listed in Chinese data as being from Malaysia; ships may travel from Iran with their transponders switched off and then turn them on when they are near Malaysia, Smith said, or transfer the Iranian oil to other ships.



Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said in a November email: China significantly reduced its imports from Iran from around 800,000 barrels per day in 2018 to 100,000 in late 2019. But by the time Trump left office, they were back to upwards to 600(000)-700,000 barrels.",,"The claim that President Trump successfully pressured China into ceasing oil purchases from Iran is inaccurate. While it is true that China's oil imports from Iran saw a temporary decline during the Trump administration, specifically in 2019, this does not equate to a complete halt in trade.

In November, Matt Smith, the lead oil analyst for the Americas at Kpler, a market intelligence firm, clarified that Chinese crude imports from Iran never fully stopped. Smith pointed out that official statistics indicated no purchases of Iranian crude in January 2021, the last partial month of Trump's presidency, and during the majority of Biden's first year in office. However, he also highlighted the reality that China had employed various tactics to obscure its ongoing oil imports from Iran.

Industry experts, including Smith, have noted that Iranian crude is often misrepresented in Chinese data as originating from Malaysia. This misrepresentation is achieved by ships traveling from Iran with their transponders switched off, then turning them on when they are near Malaysia, or by transferring the Iranian oil to other ships.

Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, provided further context in November. He noted that China significantly reduced its imports from Iran from around 800,000 barrels per day in 2018 to 100,000 barrels per day by late 2019. However, by the time Trump left office, China's imports had risen again, reaching upwards of 600,000-700,000 barrels per day.

In conclusion, while President Trump may have successfully influenced China to reduce its oil imports from Iran, the claim that this led to a complete cessation of trade is false. China continued to import Iranian oil through various means, and by the end of Trump's presidency, its imports had increased once again."
"Trump claimed: Venezuela  their crime is down 72%. Theyre taking their drug dealers.

Theyre taking  frankly, their prisoners, theyre emptying out their prisons. Theyre taking their criminals, their murderers, their rapists and theyre delivering them","Trump greatly overstated the Biden-era decline in crime in Venezuela, at least according to the limited statistics that are publicly available. And while it is certain that at least some criminals have joined law-abiding Venezuelans in a mass exodus from the country amid the economic crisis of the last decade, there is no proof Venezuela has deliberately emptied prisons for migration purposes or intentionally sent ex-prisoners to the United States.



Right-wing website Breitbart published a vague 2022 article about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents about freed violent prisoners from Venezuela who had then joined migrant caravans. But this supposed claim about Venezuelas actions has never been corroborated; experts have told CNN, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org that they know of no proof of any such thing having happened.



We have no evidence that the Venezuelan government is emptying its prisons or mental health institutions to send them outside the country, in other words, to the U.S. or any other country, Roberto Briceño-León, founder and director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, an independent organization that tracks violence in the country, said in an email to CNN in June.



Venezuelas government does not publish reliable official crime statistics, so its hard to get a complete picture. But Briceño-Leóns group publishes annual data on violent deaths, which includes homicides, police killings and deaths still under investigation. It found a decline of roughly 26% in the number of violent deaths from 2021 to 2023.



Thats substantial, but not 72%. Briceño-León noted in his email that you could find a decline of roughly 70% by 2023 if you compared 2018 to 2023  but Trump was US president until early 2021.



And crime trends in any country always have a complex mix of causes; Venezuela is no exception. Briceño-León argued that while migration has been a factor in the decline, crime has dropped in large part because the economic crisis has reduced opportunities for crime.



Bank robberies disappear because there is no money to rob; kidnappings decrease because there is no cash to pay the ransoms; robberies on public transportation stop because travelers have no money in their pockets and old cell phones [with] no value, he said.

",,"The claim made by President Trump regarding a 72% decline in crime in Venezuela and the government's alleged actions of emptying prisons to send criminals to the U.S. is not supported by verified data or credible sources. The statistics cited by Trump are significantly exaggerated when compared to the available data.

Firstly, the claim of a 72% drop in crime is not substantiated by the most recent and reliable figures. The Venezuelan Observatory of Violence reports only a 26% reduction in violent deaths from 2021 to 2023. This data does not reflect the full spectrum of crime, as Venezuela's government does not publish comprehensive official crime statistics. Comparing 2018 to 2023 would indeed show a steeper decline, but this period extends beyond Trump's presidency.

Secondly, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the Venezuelan government is intentionally releasing prisoners to facilitate migration. Roberto Briceño-León, the director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, has explicitly stated that there is no proof of such actions. The organization's findings indicate that the decline in crime is more closely associated with the economic crisis, which has diminished the incentives for criminal activities.

The economic downturn has led to a decrease in opportunities for crimes such as bank robberies, kidnappings, and robberies on public transportation. With fewer people having money or valuable possessions, the rationale for engaging in these crimes has diminished.

In conclusion, the claim of a dramatic decline in crime and the deliberate release of criminals by the Venezuelan government to the U.S. is unfounded. The available data and expert opinions suggest that the reduction in crime is more likely due to the economic hardships faced by the Venezuelan population rather than any government-led initiative to empty prisons."
"Trump repeated a claim he has made before about the Congo and migration, again without specifying whether he was referring to the Democratic Republic of Congo or the neighboring Republic of Congo.
He said: From Africa, from the Congo theyre coming, from the Congo. And, 22 people came in from the Congo recently and theyre murderers. And they drop em. They take em out of jails  which is very expensive, you know, to maintain the jails  they dont do too much maintaining, I can tell you. But they take em out of jails, prisons. They take em out, and they bring them to the United States.","Trumps claim is baseless. Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo, plus both pro-immigration and anti-immigration organizations in the US, told CNN in March, after Trump made a similar claim, that they had not seen any evidence of Congolese prisons being emptied, let alone evidence of either country somehow having brought ex-prisoners into the US. Trumps presidential campaign and an allied super PAC did not respond to requests to provide any evidence. A CNN search of two media databases turned up no evidence. 



Everything he is saying isnt true, Democratic Republic of Congo spokesperson Patrick Muyaya Katembwe told CNN in a text message in March. Asked specifically about Trumps claims about Congolese prisons being emptied of violent criminals, he said, Never ever, its not true. And, he said, we want him to stop telling these stories, since its very bad for the country.



Serge Mombouli, the Republic of Congos ambassador to the US, said in an email to CNN in March: There is no truth or any sign nor a single fact supporting such a claim or statement.



There were also some Congolese migrants apprehended at the US border under Trump. You can read a more detailed fact check here.",,"In light of the recent claims made by former President Donald Trump, it is essential to examine the veracity of his statements regarding Congolese migration and prisons. Trump's assertion that individuals from the Congo are being released from prisons and then brought to the United States is not substantiated by credible evidence or expert opinion.

Experts in the field, including Patrick Muyaya Katembwe, a spokesperson for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), have explicitly denied any such practices, stating that there is ""never ever"" any truth to the claim. Muyaya Katembwe emphasizes the detrimental impact such allegations could have on the country's reputation. Similarly, Serge Mombouli, the ambassador of the Republic of Congo (RoC) to the United States, has also refuted the claim, asserting that ""there is no truth or any sign nor a single fact supporting such a claim or statement.""

Furthermore, an examination of available data and reports from both Congolese and American sources reveals no evidence of systematic practices that would facilitate the alleged transfer of Congolese prisoners to the United States. The Congolese migrants apprehended at the US border are not the result of an organized scheme to empty Congolese prisons but rather a reflection of the complex and multifaceted factors that contribute to migration, including economic hardship, political instability, and humanitarian crises.

It is crucial to approach claims of this nature with a critical eye, recognizing the potential harm they can cause to individuals and nations. As such, the claim that the DRC and RoC are orchestrating the release of violent criminals to enter the United States is baseless and lacks credible support from experts and organizations on both sides of the issue."
